""" 
The question_id=34 part comes from <int:question_id>. Using angle brackets “captures” part of the URL and sends it as a keyword argument to the view function. The question_id part of the string defines the name that will be used to identify the matched pattern, and the int part is a converter that determines what patterns should match this part of the URL path. The colon (:) separates the converter and pattern name.
